Numpy 

## Numpy program to perform element wise operations on array.

```
 import numpy 
 height = [1.7,1.6,1.71,1.89]
 weight = [65.4,59.2,63.6,88.4]
 np_height = numpy.array(height)
 np_weight = numpy.array(weight)
 bmi = np_weight/np_height**2
 bmi
 #array([22.62975779, 23.125     , 21.75028214, 24.7473475 ])
```
Important thing to note here is that the variables inside this can only be of string type.

If not there are all converted to strings.

The rules differ for numpy array and normal python list.

```
python_list = [1,2,3]
np_python_list = np.array(python_list)
python_list + python_list -> [1,2,3,1,2,3]
np_python_list + np_python_list ->[2,4,6]
```
